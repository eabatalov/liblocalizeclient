loads the most suitable of all available dictionaries and then, when you need a string, 
the library will return it already localized.

## API

Loads the most suitable dictionary from tha directory specified with `path`, runs `callback` when finished. 
Should be called before the first use of `get` function.

### get(key, dynamicSubstringsDict)
